                <h2>Historical</h2>
                <h3>Long Time Back</h3>
                <p>Although pre-European records are scarce, deep shell heaps indicate Native American footprints dating back 5000 years.  The first written records from 100 years after the beginning of European trade contacts describe the Wabanaki people.  They knew the land as "Pemetic" meaning the sloping land and survived off the land by hunting, fishing and gathering plants and berries.</p>
                <h3>European Contacts</h3>
                <p>The initial historical records of European contact is credited to Frenchman Samuel Champlain whose expedition brought him to Pemetic on September 5, 1604 around 16 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.  "The mountain summits are all bare and rocky......I name it Isles des Monts Deserts" he wrote.</p>
                <p>In 1613, French Jesuits established the first French mission in the Americas on Mount Desert Island.  Not much later an English ship destroyed the French mission.  The land remained contested territory for the next 150 years and was used primarily as landmark for seamen.  During this period there was a time of rekindled French activity on Mount Desert Island.  In 1688, Antoine Laumet arrived on the island.  He changed his name to Antoine de Lamothe and conferred on himself the title of Sieur de Cadillac.  It is likely that for his new name and title he drew inspiration from the barony of Lamothe-Bardigues and the commune of Cadillac, both places close to his birthplace.  He sought and received a hundred thousand acres of land along the Maine coast.  He resided there for a short while and then moved on later gaining recognition as the founder of Detroit, Michigan.  Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park is named after him.</p>
                <p>After a century and half of conflict and with British troops triumphing over the French in Quebec, lands along the coast of Maine opened for English settlement in 1759.  Francis Bernard, Governor of Massachusetts, obtained a royal grant on Mount Desert Island and attempted to secure his claim by offering free land to settlers.  The onset of the Revolutionary War in 1775 was the beginning of the end of his claim on Mount Desert Island.</p>
                <h2>Post-Revolutionary War</h2>
                <p>When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, the United States of America granted Mount Desert Island - the western half to John Bernard, son of the Governor of Massachusetts Francis Bernard, and the eastern half to Marie Therese de Gregoire, granddaughter of Antoine de Lamothe, Sieur de Cadillac.  Both Bernard and de Gregoire sold the landholdings.  By 1820 farming, lumbering, fishing and shipbuilding had emerged as the major occupations on Mount Desert Island and the all too familiar sights of fishermen and fish racks and sailors and ship yards revealed a way of life deeply connected to the sea.</p>
                <h2>Rusticators and Cottagers</h2>
                <p>Mount Desert Island remained a sparsely populated collection of fishing villages until Thomas Cole arrived on the island in 1844.  He was a celebrated landscape artist acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School.  His paintings revealed the beauty of the island to the outside world.  After Cole's premature death in 1848, it was the second generation Hudson River School artists such as Frederic Church who continued popularizing the island to the outside world and kept people flocking there.  These were the rusticators.  They sought out accommodations with local farmers and fishermen for modest fees.  By 1880 many hotels had sprung up to keep pace with the ever growing number of vacationers.  Tourism was becoming the main industry on the island.</p>
                <p>Mount Desert Island was also becoming a retreat for the affluent people of that time.  The most prominent names - the Astors, Carnegies, Fords, Morgans, Rockefellers and Vanderbilts - all chose to spend their summers on the island.  They were discontent with the simple lodgings available on the island so they built elegant estates and called them cottages.  Many of these estates were later destroyed by the fire of 1947.</p>
                <h3>Preservation</h3>
                <p>Charles Eliot was a landscape architect with the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted in Boston who was very inspired by the great public spaces Olmsted had helped preserve and wanted to do the same at Mount Desert Island.  Eliot drew up an elaborate plan to make more of Mount Desert Island accessible to the public but before he could put his plan to action he passed away at the age of 38 from meningitis.  His father Charles W. Eliot who was the president of Harvard University at the time made it his mission to make his son's dream come true.  He established the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations with the mission to acquire either by gift or purchase land deemed important for its scenic or historic value and then manage it for public use.</p>
                <p>George Bucknam Dorr who was 50 years old at the time and living on the island in a grand house he inherited from his family started to purchase scenic parcels of the land for the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations.  After the trustees had acquired a significant part of the island, they started to look for a way to protect it by making it a national park.</p>
                <p>The idea of creating a national park from donated land had never been proposed before but Dorr was advised by Horace Albright that Congress could be bypassed if President Woodrow Wilson used the Antiquities Act to set aside 5,000 acres of the island as a national monument.  The proclamation was signed three years later in 1916.</p>
                <p>Dorr did not give up on the idea of a national park because he was afraid that if one president could unilaterally create a national monument another president could just as easily take it away.  Although his own inheritance was becoming depleted, Dorr promised not to rest until the national monument became a national park.</p>
                <p>George Dorr was introduced to John D. Rockefeller Jr. who owned an estate on the quiet side of Mount Desert Island.  Soon Rockefeller Jr. became Dorr's principal patron. Rockefeller Jr. began buying up land.  He also constructed 57 miles of carriage roads. In the end, Rockefeller spent a total of $3.5 million and donated 10,000 additional acres of land.  Dorr and Rockefeller Jr. had the support of Stephen Mather, the director of National Park Service at the time, who was enthusiastic about the idea of a national park set aside from donated land.</p>
                <p>On February 26, 1919, Sieur de Monts National Monument became a national park. It was eventually named Acadia, the French word for "heaven on earth".</p>
                <p>Dorr was named superintendent of the park and he remained in that post for the next 25 years.  He continued to advocate for the donation of private property to the park and spent what remained of his inheritance on the cause. When he passed away in 1944 his estate could pay for his funeral only because its trustees had secretly put $2,000 aside.  He had given his all to Acadia National Park.</p>
