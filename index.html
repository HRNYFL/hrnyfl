               <p>America's national parks are truly one of its best treasure.  They There are  59 protected areas in the Unired States known as national parks operated by the National Park Service agency. It takes an act of the United States Congress for an area to be designated a national park. The first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."</p>
