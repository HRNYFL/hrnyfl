                <h2>Road Trip</h2>
                <p>The All-American summer road trip is the best way to get to Acadia National Park because travelling on US Route 1 along the coast of Maine is one of the most scenic road trips in the world.  With around 5,000 miles of coastline (more than California), sandy beaches,  65 lighthouses, picturesque boating towns and the largest harvests of lobsters and blueberries in the country, there will be an abundance of dramatic scenery on the road to Acadia National Park.</p>
                <p>Select one or two towns on the way to Acadia National Park and on the way back from Acadia National Park for stopovers or overnight stay.  Kennebunkport in the south and Camden, Rockland and Wiscasset in the Mid Coast region of Maine and are all wonderful to explore as they all stand out for their ample picturesque small town charm.</p>
